TITLE:	this is an example of a SEM with
	continuous factor indicators and an
	interaction between two latent variables 
DATA:	FILE IS banco_moderacao.txt;
VARIABLE:	NAMES ARE y1-y12;
                usevariables y1-y9;


ANALYSIS:	TYPE = RANDOM;
	ALGORITHM = INTEGRATION;


MODEL:	f1 BY y1-y3;   ! VI
	    f2 BY y4-y6;   ! VM
	    f3 BY y7-y9;   ! VD
	    
	
	 
	s1 | f3 on f1;     ! o efetio de VI sobre VD varia conforme variância de S1;
	s1 on f2;          ! variável moderadora f2 tenta predizer a variância de S1;
    f3 on f2;
